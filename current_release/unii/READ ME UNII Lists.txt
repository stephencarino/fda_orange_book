SMILES		Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system

INGREDIENT_TYPE	UNII grouping based on intended role: Ionic Moiety, Ingredient Substance, Molecular Fragment, Specified Substance, Unspecified Ingredient. 
		Ionic Moiety UNIIs should not be used in the Ingredient Substance role because they are not charge-balanced. 
		Molecular Fragment UNIIs should not be used in any listing role because they have unspecified atom attachments.
		Unspecified Ingredient UNIIs are imprecise. More precise Ingredient Substance UNIIs should be used instead.
		Specified Substance UNIIs are assigned to formulations or specific physical forms of a substance (ISO 11238).
		
SUBSTANCE_TYPE	The ISO 11238 substance type used for the primary substance identity

UUID		The FDA-SRS record ID

DAILYMED	UNIIs known to be associated with regulated product listings on DailyMed	https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/
