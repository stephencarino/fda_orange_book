# FDA Orange Book
The uncompressed current FDA Orange Book (https://www.fda.gov/media/76860/download) can be found in `current-release` folder in the original txt file. A workflow action runs on every 1st of the month to sync contents of the folder to what is available on the FDA web site. The txt files have been converted to json using `csv-to-json.py`. 

These files are also available:
* `pubchem_out.json` is a file generated by a query using PUG REST from https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
* `unique_ingredients.txt` is a list of all unique active ingredients in `products.txt`
* `pubchem_results.json` is parsed from pubchem_out.json that identifies CID for each of the ingredients
* `pubchem_results_edited.json` is a manually edited version of `pubchem_results.json`
